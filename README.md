❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the 10-year risk of heart disease based on patient health data 🩺📊. The model is built using Logistic Regression and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app 🚀.

📌 Project Overview

The application takes user inputs such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, glucose, and lifestyle factors to predict whether a person is at high or low risk of heart disease. Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to ensure accurate and reliable predictions ⚙️📈.

📂 Dataset

• Framingham Heart Disease Dataset
• 🎯 Target Variable: TenYearCHD
• Includes demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors

🛠️ Technologies Used

• Python 🐍
• Pandas, NumPy
• Scikit-learn
• Streamlit
• Joblib

🔁 Machine Learning Workflow

• Data loading and exploration
• Handling missing values using median imputation
• Feature scaling with StandardScaler
• Model training using Logistic Regression
• Model evaluation using accuracy score
• Saving trained model and scaler
• Deployment using Streamlit 🚀

▶️ How to Run the App

1️⃣ Clone the repository
2️⃣ Install required libraries

pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib


3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
